# Data-Science-Project-Stroke-Prediction

Stroke is a leading cause of death in the US and a major cause of severe disability in adults. The sudden death of living brain cells due to loss of blood flow or lack of oxygen flow to brain is almost fatal.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.
The stroke prediction dataset used here contains data like age, average glucose level in body, whether or not they had a heart disease or hypertension, etc of patients.The data is split into training and test data and the training data is used to create models that predict whether or not an entry from the test data will suffer a stroke.
